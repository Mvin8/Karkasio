.. description-start
**PopFrame** is an open source library that includes methods for modeling the framework of a regional-level settlement system for assessing territories subject to reclamation/renovation, as well as modeling scenarios for changing regional facilities. The library is designed to form a universal information model of the region based on localities. 
The library also provides tools for working with the information model of the region, which allow:

1. Calculate indicators (population, birth rate, mortality) by municipal districts and municipalities.
2. Evaluate territories in relation to the framework of the settlement system.
